## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking 

Why did I choose Bubble Sort:
Although bubble sort is a relatively complex sorting algorithm—meaning it has high space complexity and longer computational processing time—I believe it is easy for beginners to understand and meets my teaching objectives.

Scan the array, then compare adjacent elements. If their order is incorrect, swap them. Repeat until no more swaps occur.

2. Pattern Recognition:

Bubble Sort typically exhibits the behaviour of “repeatedly comparing adjacent elements.”

3. Abstraction:

Users only see the input array and final sorted result; they need not know the details of each swap (though I'll demonstrate them during the process for instructional purposes).

4. Algorithm Design:
Input: User inputs a list of numbers
Process: Execute bubble_sort()
Output: Sorted list + step-by-step display
## Steps to Run
Repeatedly scan the array->

Compare adjacent elements->

Swap if out of order->

Repeat until no swaps occur
